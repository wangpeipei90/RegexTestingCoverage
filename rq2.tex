\subsection{RQ1: Test Coverage of Regular Expressions}
\label{sec:rq2}
\label{rq1:results}
%Since there are 18,514 regular expressions in 1,256 GitHub projects which are used for Full Match and of them 15,562 are tested, 2952 regular expressions in 1,256 GitHub projects are not tested. We reported 15,096 of 15,562 tested regular expressions, therefore, the number of reported regular expressions which are not tested is about $2952*\frac{15,096}{15,562} \approx 2863$. Regarding the coverages of those 2,863 untested regular expressions as zeros, we report the coverage metrics of total 17,959 regular expressions.


We address RQ1 is two ways. First, we look at the number of call sites to FullMatch methods are actually tested. Next, we look at the test coverage for each tested regular expression, 

\subsubsection{Tested Call Sites}
In the 1,225 projects, there are  18,426 call sites of the instrumented functions in Section~\ref{sec:instrumentedfunctions}. However, only 3,093 call sites are executed by the test suites. 
This means that 15,333 (83.21\%) of the call sites are not covered by the test suites. For those that are, the median of unique regular expressions per tested call site is one, with an average of five (Table~\ref{regex:distriprojects}). 

%Figure~\ref{fig:callsite} describes the projects in terms of \emph{call sites}, \emph{tested call sites}, and \emph{regular exp./tested call site} (number of regular expressions per tested call site). Figure~\ref{fig:callsite1} illustrates the distribution of call sites over 1,225 GitHub projects. Figure~\ref{fig:callsite2} illustrates the distribution of unique regular expressions executed at each call site. 
%This is a very skewed distribution as many of the call sites are never invoked by the tests; it is for this reason that we focus our discussion on just the regular expressions that are executed by the test suites. 

%\paragraph{Summary:}
\textbf{Summary:}
Of the 18,426 call sites for FullMatch methods in 1,225 GitHub projects, only 3,093 (16.8\%) are executed by the test suites. 
%Most call sites are executed by only one regular expression, but one call site is tested by 1,523 regular expressions. 
%The 15,096 regular expressions we study come from only 3,093 call sites in the 1,225 projects. In all 1,225 projects, there are .

%\subsection{Results}

%We collected 15,091 regular expressions from 1,665 Java GitHub projects. 
%Among all the regular expressions, the static DFAs for 454 regular expressions could not be built because they contain regular expression features unsupported by RE2, the length of regular expression string is larger than the string length limit of bash scripts (i.e., 131,071), or the regular expression string contains null byte which is not valid in bash scripts. 
%For the remaining 14,637 regular expressions, we dropped 9 because they are used across over 166 projects (10\% of total projects) and thus assumed to be part of third-party libraries, and dropped 1,419 because their unique inputs for matching is beyond the 90 percentile of all regular expressions. \todo{I still don't understand this "unique inputs for matching" thing}.
\subsubsection{Coverage of Tested Regular Expressions}
We successfully generated static DFAs for 15,096 regular expressions from 1,225 Java GitHub projects  and dynamic DFAs for 899,804 regular expression/input string pairs.\footnote{We note that 899,804 is less than $60 \times 15096 = 905760$ because the mean of {\em\# Input strings ($\lvert S \rvert$)} is 59.60546 and rounded up to 60.}%\footnote{We note that 899,804 is less than $60 \times 15096 = 905760$. To save time, for non-unique regular expressions that were tested against the same strings in multiple projects, we  computed the dynamic DFA once and counted the coverage toward both.} 
Among the regular expressions, 4,941 (32.7\%)  regular expressions have only failing inputs (i.e., $\lvert S_{succ} \rvert = 0$) and 6,029 (39.9\%) have only inputs of successful matching (i.e.,  $\lvert S_{fail} \rvert = 0$). This means that 10,970 (72.7\%) of the regular expressions do not contain test inputs that exercise both the matching and non-matching scenarios. Of these, 6,318 (41.9\%) regular expressions contain only one test string (i.e., $\lvert S \rvert = 1$) There are  4,126 (27.3\%) regular expressions with both failed and successful matchings. %\footnote{Data are available at \texttt{blinded for review}} % \url{https://github.ncsu.edu/pwang7/ISSTA2018/tree/master/data}.}.

Table~\ref{regex:distri} describes properties of the test input sets for each regular expression: \emph{$\lvert S \rvert$} is the size of the test suite, computed as the number of unique input strings for a regular expression; $\lvert S_{succ} \rvert$ means the number of matching inputs; $\lvert S_{fail} \rvert$ means the number of failing inputs; \emph{succ_ratio} shows the ratio of successful matchings to all matchings for each regular expression; \emph{fail_ratio} shows the ratio of failed matchings to all matchings for each regular expression. 
%Since 6,318 (41.9\%) of the regular expressions have a single input string, we show the data for all regular expressions (top) and for just those where $\lvert S \rvert > 1$.
%Table~\ref{regex:distri} describes the distribution of the regular expressions' attributes after data cleaning.
%75\% of the all regular expressions keep a simple DFA graph. \todo{what is a "simple" DFA graph?} The matching between a regular expression and an input string could be repeated multiple times in the same project or across multiple projects. Almost all the regular expressions are used in only one project. The regular expressions used in the third-party libraries still exist but there are only few of them.

%We calculated both the coverages for each unique regular expression across all projects as shown in Figure~\ref{cov:stack}. Table~\ref{cov:data} shows the detailed coverage statistics in each combination of coverage types and matching types.

%\todo{I want a table with the results for easy comparison, similar to the one of the regular expression attributes. A boxplot is useful for visual, but I think the text below would be more clear in a table format. }
Table~\ref{cov:data} describes the distributions of Node Coverage (NC), Edge Coverage (EC), and Edge-Pair Coverage (EPC) over $S$, $S_{succ}$, and $S_{fail}$. Figure~\ref{cov:stack} displays this information graphically; {\em total} means the total number of input strings for each regular expression, namely the test suite $S$, {\em success} means  $S_{succ}$, and {\em failure} means $S_{fail}$. %\todo{explain the figure. Explain that {\em success} means $S_{succ}$ and so forth}
Most of the regular expressions are not tested thoroughly since the mean values of coverage are low, especially the edge and edge-pair coverage. 
%The coverage of successful matchings starts from 0\% because the ratio of successful matching is 0\% for the first quarter. 
Although the coverages on failed matchings are relatively small, they contribute to a high overall test coverage. Failed matching tests are a necessary part of testing regular expressions.% Compared to successful matchings, failed matchings have a lot of outliers.

%In Figure~\ref{cov:stackNot1} we present the results including regular expressions whose input strings are more than one because there is a high possibility that the regular expressions which have only one input string are just accidentally recorded while running Maven test. While the coverage metrics on total matchings and successful matchings are lower, the coverage metrics on failed matchings are higher than them in Figure~\ref{cov:stack}.

%\todo{Characterize a typical regular expression with multiple inputs here. State the regular expression, list some of the test strings, enumerate the sizes of $S$, $S_{succ}$ and $S_{fail}$. Describe NC, EC, and EPC.-----I think this is done in Table~\ref{coverageExample}}

%\paragraph{Summary:}
\textbf{Summary:}
%\todo{add a summary statement here}
A majority of regular expressions (10,970, 97.7\%) are tested with exclusively passing (6,029, 39.9\%) or exclusively failing (4,931, 32.7\%) test inputs. 
Edge and edge-pair coverage are both very low. 
Full node coverage is infeasible with only passing inputs as $N_e$ would never be covered; the presence of both types of inputs is important for thorough testing. 
%From the coverage analysis of 15,096 regular expressions, we can find that 1) It is more difficult to get high coverages of edges and edge-pairs than of nodes; 2) There is an upper bound for EC and EPC with only successful matching input strings; 3) regular expressions could achieve higher coverages if it is tested with both successful and failed matching input strings.


% 
%The regular expression testing coverages are correlated with their number of input strings as shown in Table~\ref{cov:input}. \texttt{Total} means the correlation between the coverages and total number of inputs. \texttt{Succ_ratio} shows the correlation between the coverages and the ratio of inputs on successful matchings over total inputs. \texttt{Fail\_ratio} shows the correlation between the coverages and the ratio of inputs on failed matchings over total inputs. \texttt{Success} shows the correlation between the coverages and the number of inputs on successful matchings. \texttt{Failure} shows that between the coverages and the number of inputs on failed matchings. The first three columns of \texttt{Node}, \texttt{Edge}, and \texttt{Epair} are the correlation coefficients between the node, edge, and edge-pair coverages among 15,096 regular expressions and their corresponding inputs or \texttt{Succ_ratio}. The second three columns are the correlation coefficients between the node, edge, and edge-pair coverages among the 8,778 regular expressions which have more than one inputs and their corresponding inputs or \texttt{Succ_ratio}. For example, 0.702 is the coefficient between the edge coverage of successful matchings among the 15,096 regular expressions and the number of unique inputs for successful matchings of the 15,096 regular expressions; 0.437 is the coefficient between the node coverages of total matchings among the 8,778 regular expressions and the ratio of unique inputs for successful matchings over the total unique inputs among the 8,778 regular expressions.
%
%
%From the Table~\ref{cov:input} we can see that the correlations between the coverages and total number of inputs is uncertain, but there does exist correlations between the coverages and \texttt{Succ_ratio}. The coefficients between the coverages and \texttt{Succ_ratio} fluctuates around 0.5 implying that successful matchings and failed matchings contribute to the coverages approximately equally. The coefficients between the coverages and \texttt{Fail_ratio} is right opposite of those with \texttt{Succ\_ratio}. The coefficients between the coverages and \texttt{Success} are all above 0.6, meaning that more unique inputs for successful matching, the higher successful coverages will be. Similarly, there are positive correlations between the coverages and the unique inputs for failure matchings. Note that the coefficients between the coverages among the 8,778 regular expressions and the inputs for failed matchings are less than that among the 15,096 regular expressions. A possible reason is that \texttt{Succ_ratio} is smaller in the 8,778 regular expressions which is shown in Table~\ref{regex:distri}.
%
%Since the correlations between the coverages and the total number of inputs are uncertain, we conducted two set of two-factor analysis of variances (ANOVAs) for the 15,096 and 8,778 regular expression separately with coverages on all matchings as dependent variables and total number of inputs (total) and number of inputs for successful matchings (succ) as independent variables as shown in Table~\ref{cov:anova}. Note that the number of inputs for failed matchings (fail) is a variable depending on total and succ. Each cell represents the F-value with significance signs. From Table~\ref{cov:anova} we can see that the node, edge, and edge pair coverages on total matching are highly related to both the number of successful matching and the ratio of successful matching over total inputs. In other words, the total number of inputs and the proportion of successful matchings and failed matchings make effects on the coverages over total matchings. 
%
%Table ~\ref{regex:uncovered} shows the statistics on uncovered nodes, edges, and edge pairs. It also shows the number and ratio of regular expressions whose nodes, edges, or edge pairs are fully covered. \texttt{Node, Edge, Epair} shows the statistics of number of uncovered nodes, edges, and edge pairs. \texttt{Node\_ratio, Edge\_ratio, Epair\_ratio} show the percentage of uncovered nodes over all nodes, uncovered edges over all edges, and uncovered edge pairs over all edge pairs. Around 10\% of 15,096 regular expressions have fully covered nodes. But the regular expressions of fully covered edges and edge pairs are less than 1\% which means that edge and edge pair coverages are more difficult to achieve than node coverages. The regular expressions having more than one inputs make little difference on uncovered and fully covered statistics.
%
%Table~\ref{cov:regexLen} shown the correlation coefficients between the length of regular expression string and the DFA parameters (i.e., nodes, edges, edge pairs).
%%\todo{Is there a correlation between the length of the regular expression string and the size of the DFA? This information will provide a lot more context and interest than looking at project-based numbers.}
%
%Figure~\ref{cov:stars1} and Figure~\ref{cov:stars2} shows the relationship between different project stars and their coverages over all matchings. Figure~\ref{cov:tests1} and Figure~\ref{cov:tests2} shows the relationship between project test ratios and their coverages over all matchings. From these figures, we can hardly see the impact of project stars and test ratios on coverages. Therefore, we conducted Spearman correlation analysis between the coverages and stars, between the coverages and test ratios as shown in Table~\ref{cov:quality}. We also conducted ANONV with the coverages on total matchings as the dependent variable, test ratios and stars as independent variables as shown in Table~\ref{cov:repo}. These tables demonstrate that both test ratios and stars are highly related to coverages. However, the same information does not appear in the figures mentioned above. We use the star number of a GitHub project as an indicator of its quality. Projects with more stars are usually more popular and of high quality, but the number of such projects will decrease at the same time. As a result, we could not draw conclusions that coverages are impacted by project qualities (indicated by test ratio and star numbers).
%
%%\todo{we are also missing a discussion on comparing our metrics to classic metrics. How many regular expressions were *uncovered*? How many achieved statement but not branch coverage (i.e., were only tested with successful input strings, or only with failing input strings?}
